# Vid-io
A UI design idea for a video sharing platform.

Responsiveness for mobile displays is important for any design, but the inspiration for Vid.io is based purely on this.
The bulk of the build is in Bootstrap, and the idea is that it looks the same on every device. Features following this idea include the menu pulling in from the side to maximise screen real estate on bigger devices, and the centre search bar ensuring ease of access on smaller devices.

The theme uses flat colours; this hopefully makes the design easy on the eyes.

As of January 22nd 2018, this design is for the home page only, although I will probably add more pages in the future, such as personal and creator profile pages.
